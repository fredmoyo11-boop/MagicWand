This refers to the milestone tow of the project with the following tasks

# Define the gesture vocabulary

    To that end we defined 3 different gesture from left to right clockwise:
      - Circular drawing --> Spellname : Orbrix
      - Triangular drawing --> Spellname : Threnix
      - Rectangular drawing --> Spellname : Quadrix

# Record sensor data for each gesture

    See the recordings folder in python-recorder. Each spell has its data recorded separately.

# Plot the recorded data

    See the recordings folder in python-recorder. Each spell has its data ploted separately.

# Magic Wand â€“ Gesture Classifier
